Task 5.1 Initial Test (0 Setup / "default" mode)
3. Check: 
    ○ Does the Logo and CSS from Port 6000 load?
no, because port 6000 - (failed)net::ERR_UNSAFE_PORT
I think it's not related with task (I found only one way to "fix" it - run chrome.exe --explicitly-allowed-ports=6000, but it feels wrong);
so I changed port to 6001 - now everything loads correctly

    ○ Does the Support Chat from Port 4000 successfully fetch data?
clicking on button with fetch:
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:4000/messages' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
GET http://localhost:4000/messages net::ERR_FAILED 200 (OK)
all scripts in other cases loaded successfully, but if they have type="module" - same error 

    ○ Open Developer Tools (F12) -> Console. Identify any red CORS errors.
ERR_UNSAFE_PORT -  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/refs/heads/master/net/base/port_util.cc - 6000 port is for X11 
CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' - server response doesn't have this info in its header, so by default - any origin don't allowed


Task 7: The Malicious Toggle
    4. Analysis: Check the Network Tab. Identify which ports provided resources and which headers (like Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) enabled this interaction.
weather.js - status 200 - type script - requested index.html from port 3000 - GET /weather.js from port 5000
